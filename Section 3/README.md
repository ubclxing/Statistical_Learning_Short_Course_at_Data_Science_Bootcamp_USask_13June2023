# Session 3: Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net  
In this section, we will focus on ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net. These are advanced regression techniques that can effectively handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection. 

## Overview
We will work with the **Auto** dataset, which contains information about various car models.

### Data Preparation and Exploration
- Load the Auto dataset
- Explore the structure of the data
- Check for missing values
### Formatting the Data
- Convert relevant variables to factors
- Create the design matrix and outcome variable
### Ridge Regression
- Build the ridge regression model
- Perform cross-validation to select the best lambda
- Evaluate model accuracy using mean squared error (MSE)
### Lasso Regression
- Build the lasso regression model
- Perform cross-validation to select the best lambda
- Evaluate model accuracy using MSE
### Elastic Net Regression
- Perform cross-validation to select the best alpha and lambda
- Build the elastic net regression model
- Evaluate model accuracy using MSE

## Schedule
- 3:50pm-4:10pm: Kyle will walk through the R code in the html file and explain the sections for ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net.
- 4:10pm-4:30pm: Students will engage in hands-on practice by completing simple questions to reinforce students' understanding. The TA and tutors will be availabe to assist and answer any questions
- 4:30pm: The solutions to the practice questions will be released.
