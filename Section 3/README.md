# Session 3: Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net  
In this section, we will focus on ridge regression, lasso regression, and elastic net regression. These are advanced regression techniques that can effectively handle multicollinearity and perform variable selection. 

## Overview
We will work with the **Auto** dataset, which contains information about various car models.

### Data Preparation and Exploration
- Load the Auto dataset
- Explore the structure of the data
- Check for missing values
### Formatting the Data
- Convert relevant variables to factors
- Create the design matrix and outcome variable
### Ridge Regression
- Build the ridge regression model
- Perform cross-validation to select the best lambda
- Evaluate model accuracy using mean squared error (MSE)
### Lasso Regression
- Build the lasso regression model
- Perform cross-validation to select the best lambda
- Evaluate model accuracy using MSE
### Elastic Net Regression
- Perform cross-validation to select the best alpha and lambda
- Build the elastic net regression model
- Evaluate model accuracy using MSE

## Schedule
- 3:50pm-4:05pm: Kyle will share his insights and experiences on the topic.
- 4:05pm-4:25pm: Take some time to practice what you've learned and complete some simple tasks on your own.
- 4:25pm-4:30pm: We will release the solutions and address any errors or questions with the assistance of Lina and Jing.
