# Data Management Practice Questions

1. Using the built-in data `diamonds` from the 'ggplot2' package by using `data()` function 
   and view the variable names by using `names()` function.

2. Use the existing variable `price` from the `diamonds` dataset to create a new column/variable named      
  `price200`. The values for `price200` calculated from `price` minus $200; create a new column/variable
   name `pricepercarat`. The values for `pricepercarat` calculated from the ratio of `price` to `carat`.
   
3. Save your changes on step 2 to the new object name `diamonds_new`.

4. Creates four new columns to the `diamonds_new` dataset that calculate the mean, 
   standard deviation, standard error, and median `price` value for all diamonds.
   
5. Calculate the mean price of all of the diamonds within `dianmonds_new` dataset by using the 
   `summarize()` function.
   
6. Only display data from `diamonds_new` dataset that have a cut value of Fair or Good and a 
   price at or under $600 by using `filter()` function.
   
7. Retain all of the columns except for `cut` and `color`.
