# Session 2: R on lm and glm
This section covers the concepts of using R for linear regression (`lm`) and generalized linear regression (`glm`). The teaching assistant (TA) for this section is Kyle, and the tutors are Lina and Jing.

## Overview
We will perform the following tasks on R:
### Working with the "Auto" dataset:
-Loading the data.
-Exploring the structure and dimensions of the data.
-Checking for missing values.
-Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
-Building a linear regression model.
-Evaluating the model accuracy.

### Working with the "Default" dataset:
 -Loading the data.
 -Recoding the outcome variable.
 -Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
 -Building a logistic regression model.
 -Evaluating the model accuracy.
