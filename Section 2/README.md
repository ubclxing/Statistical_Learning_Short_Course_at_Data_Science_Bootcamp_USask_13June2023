# Session 2: R on lm and glm
This section covers the concepts of using R for linear regression (`lm`) and generalized linear regression (`glm`). The teaching assistant (TA) for this section is Kyle, and the tutors are Lina and Jing.

## Overview
We will perform the following tasks on R:
### Working with the "Auto" dataset:
- Loading the data.
- Exploring the structure and dimensions of the data.
- Checking for missing values.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Building a linear regression model.
- Evaluating the model accuracy.

### Working with the "Default" dataset:
 - Loading the data.
 - Recoding the outcome variable.
 - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
 - Building a logistic regression model.
 - Evaluating the model accuracy.

## Schedule
- 2:00pm-2:10pm: Kyle will share his experience and insights on the topic.
- 2:10pm-2:25pm: Engage in hands-on practice and complete easy tasks to reinforce your understanding.
- 2:25pm-2:30pm: The solutions will be released, and Lina and Jing will be available to assist and address any errors or questions you may have.
