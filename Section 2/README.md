# Session 2: Linear and Logistic Regression in R
This section covers the concepts of how to utilize R to build linear and logistic regression models. The teaching assistant (TA) for this section is Kyle, and the tutors are Lina and Jing.

## Overview
We will perform the following tasks on R:
### Working with the "Auto" dataset:
- Loading the data.
- Exploring the structure and dimensions of the data.
- Checking for missing values.
- Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
- Building a linear regression model.
- Evaluating the model accuracy.

### Working with the "Default" dataset:
 - Loading the data.
 - Recoding the outcome variable.
 - Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
 - Building a logistic regression model.
 - Evaluating the model accuracy.

## Schedule
- 2:00pm-2:15pm: Kyle will walk through the R code in the html file and explain the sections for linear and logistic regression.
- 2:15pm-2:30pm: Students will engage in hands-on practice by completing simple questions to reinforce students' understanding. The TA and tutors will be availabe to assist and answer any questions.
- 2:30pm: The solutions to the practice questions will be released.
